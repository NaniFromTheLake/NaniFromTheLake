- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nani. This nickname has nothing to do with the meme, it's created from my real one. I live 500m away from the Lake Balaton, which is the greates lake in Middle- and WestEuprope
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in playing the piano, doing sports and of course programming, especially in compilers and languages (although I'm not very experienced yet).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and intermediate language, called Parrot, to build a language on it.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Discord: Nani#0374
